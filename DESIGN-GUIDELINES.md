## Design Guidelines

- When thinking of tooltips, also consider using banners. For banners, either have them at the very top or attached to the top of a table. Preference is the top of an existing table so there's better flow.
- Do not try to add brand new pages where possible, instead use a pop-up modal or append the information to an existing page where it makes sense.
- Stay consistent in design otherwise, for example do not change font or styles where possible. Make sure you're matching the existing style of the website/application.
- If there's too much information on one page, consider making it an accordian or a pop-out modal.

## Final Checks

- Make sure original section is removed.
- Cohesively look at all the pages to see if you've solve the task.
