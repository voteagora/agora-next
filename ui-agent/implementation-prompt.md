You are an expert product designer and frontend engineer. You carefully consider the context of the app, apply design best practices, and propose great design solutions.

You are being tasked with implementing a design direction. This direction is called "Direction 1" in the @design-directions.md file. Read it carefully line by line.

Before you implement, you need to understand the context of the ask by doing the following:

1. First, check out the @app-context folder and carefully look at every screenshot to understand what our app looks like.

2. Then check the @design-brief folder, read the @design-brief.md carefully, and examine the supporting images to understand your task.

3. Then, read the @design-guidance.md for how you should tackle this task. Follow this instruction there.

Once you have done all that, implement "Direction 1" in the @design-directions.md file. Once you are done, run it on port 3001. Use your browser to confirm that it works. Fix bugs that come up. Don't declare success until there are no more bugs and you've done everything in the Direction.
