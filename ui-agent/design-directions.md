## Design direction – Compact, dismissible helper banners + Info page as the canonical “Governance 101”

Core concept: **Turn the long on-page tutorials into short, dismissible helper banners that point to richer, permanent education on the Info page.**

- **Proposals / “Voting process” card**: Delete the tall `Voting process` card rendered by `SyndicateProposalsPageContent` and replace it with a single, thin, dismissible banner directly above the proposals list using the existing banner style from the `ui-reference` examples.
- **Proposals copy destination**: Move the full legal and step-by-step copy from the old `Voting process` card into a new “Voting process” section on the Info page, formatted as short paragraphs or a 3-step process (no nested bullet lists), with headings for Temp-Check, Member Vote, and Execution.
- **Proposals link-back**: In the new proposals-page banner, include one concise line summarizing the lifecycle and a `Learn how proposals work` text link that deep-links to the “Voting process” section on Info.
- **Voters / “How voting power works” card**: Replace the tall `SyndicateVotersPageContent` card at the top of the Voters page with a compact, dismissible banner attached to the `Delegates` section header that states in one sentence that users must choose where voting power lives, plus a `Learn about voting power` link to the Info page.
- **Voters / “Why it’s designed this way” copy**: Move the “Why it's designed this way” explanation out of the Voters page entirely and integrate it as a short sub-section within the Info page’s “How voting power works” section.
- **Self-Delegation card**: Replace the `Self-Delegation` tutorial card in `SyndicateDelegateInfo` with a concise “Your voting setup” row above the delegates table that shows current status (e.g. “You haven’t set your voting power yet” or “You are self-delegated”) plus a primary `Delegate to self` button and one short supporting line.
- **Delegate to Other Members card**: Remove the separate `Delegate to Other Members` tutorial card and fold its key reassurance into the same “Your voting setup” row as a single sentence (“Delegating never moves your tokens; it only points your voting power”) with a `Learn about delegation` text link to a “Delegating to others” section on Info, where the full WY DUNA legal explanation lives.
- **Dismissal behavior**: Make both new banners (on Proposals and Voters) fully dismissible per user and per wallet (stored client-side or server-side), with no lingering placeholder space once closed and no way to re-open from the main surfaces, aligning with the guideline that educational content on non-info pages should disappear once dismissed.

Reasoning: This direction keeps the primary functional pages (Proposals and Voters) focused on actions while still giving new users guardrails through small, well-placed helpers. The Info page becomes the single, authoritative location for dense legal and process content, and the new “Your voting setup” row gives the self-delegation button a clear, permanent home without large tutorial blocks.
