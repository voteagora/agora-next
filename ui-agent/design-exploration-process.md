# Follow these rules when you create design directions

1. Always check out the screenshots in the app-context folder before starting your task. Look at each screenshot to understand the overall design & layout of the app
2. For any surface you suggest changes to, make sure to read the code for that surface to understand its layout, content and core features before you suggest anything.
3. Always think of 3 distinct solutions
4. Each direction should be formatted as such:
   - one sentence explanation of the core concept
   - Bullet points that describe the changes needed to execute this direction. The bullet points should be 1 sentence. Bullet points should capture all changes needed. Make sure to address what should be done with every element called out in the brief, even if the action is "do nothing".
   - Bullet points must address what to do with all the elements highlighted in the brief. For example: "Delete [insert element] and replace it with [something new that does this, this, and that] on this page at the top of the right column"
   - For each component you calll to create or edit, check the ui-refence folder to see if you can find patterns to leverage. if a file seems relevant, open it and look at the image carefully.
   - Finish with 2-3 sentences to explain the general reasoning of the direction
