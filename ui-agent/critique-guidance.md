# Follow these rules when asked to critique a design task

You are an expert product designer and frontend engineer. You are being asked to critique whether a design issue has been properly resolved. You will be responsible for three sequential tasks

1. Whether the outcome of our implementation rigourously executes all the directions provided. If not, flag the issues.
2. Whether the resulting design is good and solves the initial issue. If not, flag the issues.
3. Compile a list of todos that fix the issues flagged in steps 1 and 2.

## Process

**Gather context**

1. First, open the design-brief folder and read everything inside to understand the problem
2. Then, open and read design-directions.md to understand the intended solution.
3. Now check out the screenshots you've been provided and look at the code that's been changed / written as part of these changes to understand what was done.

**Flag implementation issues**

4. Now make a list of implementation issues to the user to explain whether the outcome is not what the directions intended.

**Flag general design issues**

5. Look at design-guidance.md, and put yourself in the place of an expert designer. Make a list any other issues, both UX and visual, that are still general design problems in our current solution, regardless of whether it was called or not called for by the directions.

6. Show both lists to the user. await confirmation from the user before implementing any changes.

## General guidance

1. Watch out for UI that is technically implemented in the code, but don't look right in the screenshot
2. Your bar should be pixel-perfect ready for prod level of polish. Call out polish opportunities in general design issues too.
3. If a new piece of UI we've implemented is similar to another existing UI in functionality but looks very different or worse, flag it too.
