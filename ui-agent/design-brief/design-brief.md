# Design brief: Tutorials & disclosures re-design

The user provided a raw prompt elsewhere. We've cleaned it up and turned it into this design brief. Reference the images in this folder for additional context on the brief.

## Context

Our legal partner flagged that for new users of the site, it's not always clear how the delegation & voting process works. This can lead to confusion and low participating.

As a last minute pre-launch fix, they suggested adding some tutorial / disclosures as blocks of text at the top of the proposals page and voter page. Specifcally the "How voting power works", "Self-Delegation", "Delegate to Other Members" and "Voting process:" cards. We know it's a temporary patch that's not good design, and now we want to come back and clean up our new user experience.

See the images in this folder for the specific areas with problems.

## Problems

1. The explainer content is useful once, and only to the portion of users who don't know anything about governance, and then never again, yet parmanently takes up the most valuable above-the fold space.
2. All the explainer content is in long paragraphs of text, which is not very engaging and easy to read.
3. The self-delegation button is in a tutorial card, but has no parmanent home where users would look for it.
4. The resulting UI is ugly and very unrefined, reducing the overall feeling of quality of the app

## Design goals

1. Maintain our original goal of improving the new user experience by teaching new users who don't know governance. We want to help users who are unfamiliar with voting, voting power, and delegation, get familiar with how things work
2. But do it in a way that fixes the design problems above
