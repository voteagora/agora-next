## Proposal checklist
**1. Select the proposal type**

Proposal types set the quorum and approval thresholds for your proposal. Select the correct type for the proposal that you're making.

**2. Choose your vote type**

This determines if your proposal will be a simple yes/no or a multiple choice.

**3. Create your proposal draft**

Now that the vote and proposal type are set, you can create your proposal by giving it a title, description, and optionally a set of transactions to execute.

**4. Submit your draft onchain**

If you meet the proposal threshold or are the manager of the governor, then you can submit your draft onchain as a proposal. If you do not meet these requirements, you can find a sponsor for your proposal who does.
