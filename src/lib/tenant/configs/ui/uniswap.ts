  ## Proposal checklist

  **1. Create your proposal**

  Get started by drafting your proposal directly in the Uniswap governance interface. Clearly outline your objectives, provide supporting details, and ensure your proposal aligns with Uniswap's governance standards.

  **2. Request sponsorship (if threshold not met)**

  If you don't meet the required voting power threshold, you can request sponsorship from existing delegates. This allows your proposal to gain visibility and the necessary backing from the community.

  **3. Submit as waiting for sponsorship**

  If you don't have the voting power to post the proposal yourself, you can request a delegate with enough voting power to sponsor it. The delegate you choose can review your proposal and choose to sponsor it if they support it, pushing it onchain for voting. One note - you should coordinate with sponsor delegates so they know you're looking for sponsorship!

  **4. Submit onchain (If threshold met)**

  If you meet the voting power threshold, you can bypass the sponsorship phase and submit it onchain directly. This fast-tracks your proposal to the voting stage, giving the community the opportunity to decide on its implementation.
