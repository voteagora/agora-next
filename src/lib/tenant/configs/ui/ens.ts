## Proposal checklist

**1. Post a temp check on Discourse**

The purpose of the Temperature Check is to determine if there is sufficient will to make changes to the status quo. To create a Temperature Check, ask a general, non-biased question to the community on discuss.ens.domains about a potential change.

**2. Create a draft proposal on Github**

This determines if your proposal will be a simple yes/no or a multiple choice. To create a Draft Proposal, create a new governance proposal in the governance-docs repository on GitHub. Start by copying the template for an executable proposal, social proposal, or constitutional amendment, as appropriate. Once you have written your proposal, create a Draft Pull Request for it. Start a new post in the DAO-wide -> Draft Proposals category with a link to the PR for discussion.

**3. Create your proposal**

Now you're ready to use this form to create your proposal. Choose whether your proposal is a Social Proposal or Executable. If your proposal is a Social Proposal, that's it! If the vote passes, the proposal is passed and you are done. If it's the latter, once the propose() function has been called, a seven day voting period is started. Ongoing discussion can take place on your proposal post. If the proposal passes successfully, a two day timelock will follow before the proposed code is executed.

**4. Learn more**
